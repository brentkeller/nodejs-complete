# Node.js Complete

This is the codebase as I worked through the [Node.js - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide) course on Udemy.

The course worked through various things including different data storage stacks. I did each of the different stacks in a separate branch so they would be easily accessible for reference later. Here's a quick reference of what each branch is:

| Branch    | Description                                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| master    | Main working branch, leverages MongoDB using `mongoose`                 |
| sequelize | Basic shop using `sequelize` to connect to local MS SQL Server database |
| mongodb   | Basic shop using `mongodb` to connect to local MongoDB server           |
| mongoose  | Basic shop using `mongoose` to connect to local MongoDB server          |
