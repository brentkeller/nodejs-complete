# Node.js Complete: API Project

This is the API project from the [Node.js - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide) course on Udemy.

The course covered using express to stand up a API server. The API was built twice, once with REST and once with GraphQL. I did the GraphQL conversion in a separate branch for reference.

| Branch  | Description                            |
| ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| master  | Main working branch with a REST API    |
| graphql | Converts the REST API to use `GraphQL` |
